# Movie Recommender (Collaborative Filtering)
Link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ekERACfZYCzrr-6i4qfjViZRjf8IErjb?usp=sharing

# Description
Unlike the first movie recommender project I did, this one uses collaborative filtering. Whereas the first one recommends movies based on similar contents, the recommendation model of this project aims at finding similar users and recommend the sets of movies that users with similar interest like. I use both Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Cosine Similarity to find the similariy between users and movies that they like.
